UCL Machine Learning Heart Disease Prediction using Shiny Dashboard and R language in R Studio

## Introduction
This dashboard attempts to improve the performance of the classifiers by doing experiments using multiple machine-learning models to make better use of the dataset collected from different medical databases. The dashboard will help the doctors to diagnose the disease in the patients by analysis of dataset using different analysis techniques like the Random forest, Decision tree ID3, Decision tree C4.5. It is widely used in healthcare fields due to its descriptive and predictive power. It can predict health insurance fraud, healthcare cost, disease prognosis, disease diagnosis.
